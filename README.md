To download file at custom path you can use the following instance method of MZDownloadManager:
    
```public func addDownloadTask(fileName: String, fileURL: String, destinationPath: String)```
      
#### When download completes:
    
* It will check if the destination folder still exists then it will move the downloaded file at the specified destination and call success delegate method.
* If destination folder does not exists, following delegate method will provide an opportunity to handle the downloaded file appropriately.

```optional func downloadRequestDestinationDoestNotExists(downloadModel: MZDownloadModel, index: Int, location: NSURL)```

* If the above delegate method is not implemented then it will just called the failure method.

```open var additionalData: [String: Any]?)```

#### New helper functions

New helper functions added to support downloading with additional data. 

```public func addDownloadTask(_ fileName: String, fileURL: String, destinationPath: String, additionalData: [String: Any])```
